          p1: `Super Groomers was a startup project I worked on with several partners, where we developed and tested a new product concept.`,
          p2: `The initial idea stemmed from the pain point of booking a dog grooming appointment in the Sacramento area. As my business partner was trying to book a grooming appointment he found that most providers are booked out for weeks or months.`,
          p3: `The opportunity we saw was an interface that bridges the gap between customers seeking grooming services and providers offering these services. The final scope of this venture was to build a portal that makes it easy for customers to find and book pet grooming appointments. The grooming service providers would also benefit by receiving additional business with no added promotional or marketing cost.`,
          p4: `This is the initial MVP prototype we built, which aimed to provide a proof of concept and market research.`,

      text: {
        p1: `The user journey of this application is intuitive and simple. The goal is to make a request for a grooming appointment and get matched with a grooming service provider. `,
        p2: `The user starts by selecting their location followed by  entering their pet’s information and selecting the grooming services. The user can then review and confirm this information, edit this information or add an additional pet. `,
        p3: `Next the user enters their personal information and selects three dates and time options that work for them for the grooming appointment. `,
        p4: `Finally the user can review all the information before submitting the request. This information is then sent to our application backend, where we receive this information and match the user with a grooming service provider that has availability and can meet this customers service request.`,

          p1: `For this prototype I had the opportunity to work with an award winning Senior Product and UI Designer, who put together a beautiful UI design for our MVP.`,
          p2: `The result is an inviting and intuitive form that makes it easy for users to enter their pet’s information and make a grooming appointment request. `,
          p3: `I built the MVP frontend with react to the exact specifications of the given design. React was especially useful for this application, because we needed the persistence of state of the entered information throughout the different pages and components of the application. Also we needed conditional rendering of this information on the confirmation pages. `,
          p4: `At every stage of this form application users have the opportunity to go back and edit or add information and requested services. Users also have the option add additional pets to add to the booking request.`,

          p1: `The purpose of our MVP prototype, was to test if our concept can work and meets market demand. The core principle of our project that we were testing was the ability to bridge the gap between customers and service providers, and make a connection that benefits both sides and can be monetized. `,
          p2: `During our market test we initially saw some signs of success. However, ultimately we found various barriers that forced us to go back to the drawing board to rethink the fundamental approach of this venture. `,

Therefor, it is essential to approach this feature with attention to detail and make it a priority of the application. When potential customers are browsing the pages of different restaurant in the area, a well designed menu can make the difference to capturing the customer’s business. `,
          p2: `My design for this feature builds around the importance of visual impressions when deciding on what to eat. Presenting the menu not just in form of a simple list with dish names, but presenting the individual dishes visually, invites the customer to order and try new items. `,
          p3: `The use of card elements is a perfect solution to display the dish information along with visuals, while also allowing a dynamic display across various screen sizes. `,
